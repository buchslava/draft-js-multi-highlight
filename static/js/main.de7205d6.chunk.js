The old man is very cautious, using all his knowledge, gained through decades of experience on the water, to know what to do with the line and when. The line was one hundred fathoms deep and the fish he hooked a marlin. Santiago knows immediately that he\u2019s got a very large fish on his line but he isn\u2019t sure how large. One hint of its size is the fact that the old man can\u2019t get it pulled in. Rather, it starts to pull the boat out to sea. While this might frighten some sailors, the old man is nonplussed. He knows that no matter where he ends up he\u2019ll be able to navigate back to the island. It\u2019s a \u201clong\u201d island he states, and the lights are bright.</p>\n<p>Over the next hours, and eventually days, the old man is pulled by the fish out into the sea. He does not tie the line off for fear that it will snap from the tension. Rather, he wraps it around his shoulders and back. His back begins to ache, but he knows he can bear it. He speaks out loud to himself, a habit that began after Manolin left his skiff. Santiago speaks on life, death and the brotherhood he feels with the fish on his line. Although he knows they are connected, and that the fish is a majestic creature he is determined to kill it. He wants to show the fish what man can do and he desperately needs something to sell.</p>\n"),t=c.ContentState.createFromBlockArray(e),n=Object(o.useRef)(null),i={yellow:{backgroundColor:"yellow"},red:{color:"red"},blue:{color:"blue"}},s={rules:[{content:["His back begins to ache, but he knows he can bear it."],style:"yellow",matcher:b.b},{content:["and"],style:"red",matcher:b.c},{content:["pulled","knows"],style:"blue",matcher:b.c}],styles:i},h=Object(o.useState)(s),d=Object(r.a)(h,2),g=d[0],j=d[1],k=Object(o.useState)(),p=Object(r.a)(k,2),w=p[0],m=p[1],y=Object(o.useState)(c.EditorState.createWithContent(t,Object(b.a)(g))),O=Object(r.a)(y,2),v=O[0],C=O[1];function x(){n.current.focus()}return Object(o.useEffect)((function(){v.getCurrentContent().getBlocksAsArray().forEach((function(e,t){2===t&&m(e.getKey())}))}),[v]),Object(o.useEffect)((function(){g&&C(c.EditorState.set(v,{decorator:Object(b.a)(g)}))}),[g]),Object(o.useEffect)((function(){x()}),[]),Object(a.jsxs)("div",{onClick:x,style:f.editor,children:[Object(a.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(a.jsx)("button",{disabled:!(g.rules.length>1),onClick:function(e){e.preventDefault();var t=Object(l.a)({},g);t.rules[1].content=["the"],j(t)},children:'Change "and" to "the"'}),Object(a.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(e){e.preventDefault(),j(s)},children:"Initial state"}),Object(a.jsx)("button",{disabled:!(g.rules.length>1),onClick:function(e){e.preventDefault();var t=Object(l.a)({},g);t.rules[0].content=["At noon that day, a fish takes the bait on one of his lines.","The old man is very cautious, using all his knowledge, gained through decades of experience on the water, to know what to do with the line and when.","His back begins to ache, but he knows he can bear it."],j(t)},children:"Also, select 2 first sentences"}),Object(a.jsx)("button",{disabled:!(g.rules.length>1),onClick:function(e){e.preventDefault(),j({rules:[],styles:i})},children:"Reset hightlighting"})]}),Object(a.jsx)(c.Editor,{ref:n,blockStyleFn:function(e){return e.getKey()===w?"grey-paragraph":"normal-paragraph"},editorState:v,onChange:function(e){C(e)}})]})},j=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&n.e(3).then(n.bind(null,189)).then((function(t){var n=t.getCLS,a=t.getFID,o=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,s=t.getTTFB;n(e),a(e),o(e),i(e),s(e)}))};h.a.render(Object(a.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(a.jsx)(g,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),j()},92:function(e,t,n){}},[[188,1,2]]]);
